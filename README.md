The fastest and easy way to deploy a React application is just to drag and drop the build folder in Netlify.

Steps to deploy:
1.To create a build folder, just execute the npm run build or yarn build command from the command line from your project folder.
2.Login to your Netlify account. In the dashboard, click on the New site from Git button.
3.Click on the GitHub button to connect your GitHub repository.
4.It will open a new tab. Make sure the popup is enabled in your browser.
5.Search for the GitHub repository in the Search repos search box. If your repository is not getting displayed then click on the Configure the Netlify app on GitHub button at the bottom of the page
6.Search for the repository you want to deploy. 
7.Now, click on the Deploy site button. Once clicked, we will see the Site deploy in progress message.
